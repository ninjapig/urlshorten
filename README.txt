Meant for Yahoo Back End quiz.
Project is running and hosted on:
    http://yahoourlshorten.azuresites.net

I coded the project using Python, as I saw that there weren't 
strict requirements for coding languages. If I am mistaken, please let me know
if I can correct it.

This Project can be run also on any machine that has Python and Django installed.

Instructions to run locally:
1) Download and Install Python, pip and install django
2) Execute manage.py with argument 'runserver',
   this runs a local server for the web application  
   on port 8000 by default


Thanks,
Harish
